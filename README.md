## Conclusion
To optimize stock and sales, the business should prioritize products that appeal to middle-aged adults and those in their early thirties, focusing on popular brands like Allegra R, Calvin Klein, and Carhartt. High return rates need addressing, potentially indicating quality or expectation mismatches, and more emphasis should be placed on women's products, particularly from the Allegra K brand. It's also beneficial to stock more affordable items, as they tend to sell more frequently, delivery duration does not significantly impact delivery success.
